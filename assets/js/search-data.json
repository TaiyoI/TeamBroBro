            "content": "Algorithm . An algorithm typically means &#39;code&#39; that solves a problem. Designing an algorithm often requires you to learn the Tech first and then consider how you design your code and algorithms. Code design can take many iterations. . Truth Tables . My topic for this blog is Truth Tables. The illustration that follows displays the results of logical operators AND, OR, XOR, NOT versus binary 1 and 0. The output produces a &#39;Truth Table&#39;. . . Exploring Truth Tables operations . Exploration of this topic requires searching the language for logical operators, then figuring out how to display condition and test result. . Bitwise operations for Truth Tables typically represent 1 - True and 0 - False. | Logical expression in iteration and selection statements result in True or False | . My objective is Truth Tables. But in my exploration I did both Truth Table and Expression syntax . print(&quot;OR&quot;) print( &quot;1 | 0 = &quot;, 1 | 0) print( &quot;~(1 | 0) = &quot;, ~(1 | 0) % 2) # 1 is an integer, not a bit so remainder (modulo) does trick print(&quot;AND&quot;) print( &quot;1 &amp; 0 = &quot;, 1 &amp; 0) print( &quot;~(1 &amp; 0) = &quot;, ~(1 &amp; 0) % 2) # modulo again print(&quot;XOR&quot;) print( &quot;1 ^ 1 = &quot;, 1 ^ 1) print() # Boolean Tests print(&quot;Boolean OR&quot;) print( &quot;True or False = &quot;, True or False) print(&quot;Boolean AND&quot;) print( &quot;True and False = &quot;, True and False) print(&quot;Boolean XOR&quot;) print( &quot;True != True = &quot;, True != True) .

This algorithm focuses on small reusable procedures/functions (def) for bitwise tests. From the exploratory experience above it seems like a lot of typing would be necessary to represent possibilities. . import operator # functions for all comparisons, logical operations, mathematical operations and sequence operations # builds truth table def truth_options(): a_opts = [1, 0] b_opts = [1, 0] return [(a, b) for a in a_opts for b in b_opts] # double for permutes options # provides equivalent function lookup for bitwise using operator functions def bitwise_options(op): ops = {&#39;&amp;&#39;: operator.and_, &#39;|&#39;: operator.or_, &#39;^&#39;: operator.xor} return ops[op] # control/eval for bitwise operators, selection is based on number of operators def bitwise_eval(op, op2=&quot;&quot;): if op2 == &quot;&quot;: op_func = bitwise_options(op) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{a} {op} {b} is {op_func(a, b)}&quot;) else: op2_func = bitwise_options(op2) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{op}({a} {op2} {b}) is {(1, 0)[op2_func(a, b)]}&quot;) # opposite: index 0 returns 1, index 1 return 0 def method1(): bitwise_eval(&quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NAND&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NOR&quot;, &quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;^&quot;) # call bitwise evaluation of truth table if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: print(&quot;***** Method 1 *****&quot;) method1() . ***** Method 1 ***** Bitwise &amp; 1 &amp; 1 is 1 1 &amp; 0 is 0 0 &amp; 1 is 0 0 &amp; 0 is 0 Bitwise NAND NAND(1 &amp; 1) is 0 NAND(1 &amp; 0) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 1) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 0) is 1 Bitwise | 1 | 1 is 1 1 | 0 is 1 0 | 1 is 1 0 | 0 is 0 Bitwise NOR NOR(1 | 1) is 0 NOR(1 | 0) is 0 NOR(0 | 1) is 0 NOR(0 | 0) is 1 Bitwise ^ 1 ^ 1 is 0 1 ^ 0 is 1 0 ^ 1 is 1 0 ^ 0 is 0 . Truth Table - Algorithm 2 . This algorithm above seemed to me to lose clarity with all the functions. The second attempt focuses on truth tables as a linear sequence, with loops for required repetitions. This seemed more understandable to me than my 1st attempt. . def method2(): truth_table = [[1,1], [1,0], [0,1], [0,0]] for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;and {a} &amp; {b}: {a &amp; b}&quot;) for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;nand ~({a} &amp; {b}): {((a &amp; b) + 1) % 2}&quot;) # warning: ~ negates entire integer without modulo for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;or {a} | {b}: {a | b}&quot;) for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;nor ~({a} | {b}): {((a | b) + 1) % 2}&quot;) # warning: see above for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;xor {a} ^ {b}: {a ^ b}&quot;) # call bitwise evaluation of truth table if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: print(&quot;***** Method 2 *****&quot;) method2() . ***** Method 2 ***** and 1 &amp; 1: 1 and 1 &amp; 0: 0 and 0 &amp; 1: 0 and 0 &amp; 0: 0 nand ~(1 &amp; 1): 0 nand ~(1 &amp; 0): 1 nand ~(0 &amp; 1): 1 nand ~(0 &amp; 0): 1 or 1 | 1: 1 or 1 | 0: 1 or 0 | 1: 1 or 0 | 0: 0 nor ~(1 | 1): 0 nor ~(1 | 0): 0 nor ~(0 | 1): 0 nor ~(0 | 0): 1 xor 1 ^ 1: 0 xor 1 ^ 0: 1 xor 0 ^ 1: 1 xor 0 ^ 0: 0 . Linear Sequence of code . The order of executions is strictly from top to bottom. This is good for learning, but is typically a poor method for an Algorithm! This was my 1st exploration above. . Procedure (Function) . A Procedure is a set of code instructions that has been abstracted into logical parts. Each code abstraction is called &quot;Procedural Abstraction&quot;. . In Python, using procedures (def) means you are starting to write &quot;good&quot; code vs &quot;bad&quot; code, mostly in terms of reusability of logic. | A procedure needs to be activated or called, this is performed in the main selections above. | . Hacks . As we explore the algorithm Unit students will be designing lessons and homework. Each lesson will have Hacks. Here are some hacks that could go with the lesson above. The three weeks after Thanksgiving will be focused on this activity and build personal portfolio. . Try to build a Truth Table as shown above in Python, but switch to JavaScript... . Begin by showing understanding of problem using console.log, this problem can be done in Jupyter Notebook | Build a Truth Table in JavaScript showing output in HTML, this problem is best in FastPages | . Pick your Algorithmic hack, build in Python and JavaScript. Here are some ideas.. . Binary to Hexadecimal to Decimal conversions | Fibonacci | Palindrome | Other | .

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

Qualcomm makes its money on patents, if you use GPL software you could be voiding your rights to charge for software and patents. Open Source by nature, specifically GPL, says any derivative work is free and code should be shared. Qualcomm wants all derivative work to require a royalty payment payment, also anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty. . . From synopsis.com, “Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers.” Qualcomm has had 20 technical jobs and 3 lawyers analyzing all the code produced, analyzing code for Open Source inclusion, and analyzing impact of such licenses to its ability to charge royalties for the use of their Patents. . This may sound like a simple problem, but think about the Students of Today, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet. Well, don’t think the Workers of Today are entirely different. In summary, it is important to know the type of software license you are copying, it could impact billions of dollars in business. .

Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal . The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you’ve created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain. . Open Source MIT License . This license in friendly to someone like Qualcomm! This allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions. . Open Source GPL License . The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. . For a company like Qualcomm, they are required to institute many practices to deliver their code in parts. Isolating their patent and secret code, far away from the GPL Creative Commons code. In fact, a company that is protecting their patents may need to division engineers, split distribution code, etc. Even though, the customer of the derivative work is required to put the code back together again to make it work. . Legal and Ethically . We need to comply with the terms of licenses. We need to cite sources. (I am particularly bad with internet pictures. However, in the picture of the Black Duck above I am actually advertising the Company). . As consumers, we have become aware that Music and Movie companies own content. These companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content. Most of us buy subscriptions to services. However, some figure out ways to bypass systems and allow download. Often we will see these sites disappear, as they are illegal. . In software, it can be more complicated to understand all the Creative Commons licenses and its impact to our own ideas and businesses. Mostly, if we use things in class, there is no problem with Open Source as it is considered educational use. Creative Commons software has enabled amazing innovation as we are able to do so much for free, as we have done in this class. However, Individuals and Companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license. . Long ago, I remember being amazed that Red Hat was not selling its Linux distribution, they were giving away the software. They had to as the terms of the license were GPL. However, as an early pioneers in Linux distributions, they established a business model around buying their support agreement. They rose in fortune, became a public company, and had an amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO). Many, many vendors have followed the Red Hat model in building free distributions and establish unique business models. Qualcomm figured out how to mix Patent and GPL businesses and have flourished since abandoning all proprietary, to include Android in its very complicated business model. .

In this class, we will be using Fastpages on top of GitHub Pages to maximize our presentations, while minimizing our front-end coding. GitHub Pages deployment is performed through Jekyll, which regenerates the website automatically after each commit, tracking can be seen in Actions tab within GitHub. | HTML generation is performed through Liquid, a template language (similar to Jinja2 or Thymeleaf). | CSS style layout is provided by using Themes provided through GH Pages. Each page we make we assume the defined theme and insert our HTML fragments, local page style, and local page JavaScript. | JavaScript enables pages to have actions, fetch content, animate, etc | . . . Code in this Sub Menu . HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front-end of the Web. Many tools and languages complement development using markup, style and JavaScript. This section of the Nighthawk Coders CS website is providing some code samples. These are intended to spark your own PBL ideas.

Pull this file into VSCode and explore the fundamentals of making a content page. | Calculator: This calculator was inspired by Mr. Mortensen’s calculator that he built in Objective-C during his first year of teaching at DNHS (2019). It was recreated by former student Anthony using Fastpages, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on this site in 2022.

Liquid is used to define a constant for the number of bits | JavaScript is used base 2, 8, 16 calculations | . | Grades: This grade calculator was created to show interaction of HTML and JavaScript to perform input. Additionally, it show how to add element to HTML Document Object Model (DOM). FYI, the IJavaScript kernel did not support input as of this writing. | Graph: This was created when a student named Bryant 2022 asked me the question “how would I plot data?” as described in an FRQ.

Python and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Python RESTful API libraries. A Python List is used to make a Data Model, but persistence in this technique is limited, each time server is refreshed data is lost. This example is great for learning, but data is considered volatile. | Users: Another RESTful API library example. However, this backend establishes data persistence through the use of a database. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Python to define REST APIs. Python tools are very popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods. The Users RESTful APIs would likely contain these endpoints. | GET: /users =&gt; Get a list of users | GET: /users(id) =&gt; Get a single user | POST: /users =&gt; Create a new user | PUT: /users(id) =&gt; Update a user | DELETE: /users(id) =&gt; Delete a user | . Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",
