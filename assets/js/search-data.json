It is very important to have a topic as you venture into Algorithms and Lessons. This article is a random collection of ideas in Data that could assist in learning about data and how to code data. . As you do hacks in Algorithms, pick a topic | Explore that topic in Computer Science manner (research, jupyter notebooks, frontend / backend coding) | . Math in Binary . Learn binary by bitwise operators and more. Shifting bits is a common computer operation and does wonderful things in math like multiply and divide. Last bit always determines odd or even. Look for shift on w3schools . Logic of Shift . Explore right and left shifts with binary numbers. . In an arithmetic shift, the bits that are shifted out of either end are discarded. | In a left arithmetic shift, zeros are shifted in on the right. | . Understand binary Numbers by elaboration of Shift (2^^0, 2^^1, 2^^2) . How does the Power of 2 work? What is a binary number? What is Base2, Base10, Base16. . This example uses an 8-bit register. Math can be represented in much in many more bits, 32 bits or 2 bytes is common for integer in modern computer languages. | Most Significant Bit (MSB), least (LSB) | This example shows negative and positive numbers, using technique called Twos Complement. | In the first case, the leftmost digit was shifted past the end of the register, and a new 0 was shifted into the rightmost position. Positive Multiply. | In the second case, the rightmost 1 was shifted out, and a new 1 was copied into the leftmost position, preserving the sign of the number. Negative Divide, this example obviously needs more study. | . UI Concept/Design . Conceptualize on a UI that will illustrate binary and decimal. In learning these concepts, it is best to code and example to illustrate what is happening. . n Right Shifts (divides by 2^n); n Left Shifts (multiplies by 2^n) | Add buttons for “«” and “ »” | . ASCII and Unicode . Computers represent more than Math. Mostly everyone is familiar with the characters on a keyboard and Emojis. These are all represented in binary, the data abstraction being the characters we visualize. 😂 . Character Data Abstraction . How are characters stored? How many bits do they take? . ASCII is 8 bits, it generally represent keys on keyboard. Look up ASCII Table. | Unicode can be UTF-8, 16 or 32, each representing bits. ASCII is preserved in Unicode. | ASCII - 7 bits, extended to 8 bits with Unicode | UTF-8 | UTF-16 | UTF-32 Sample of Unicode characters. | . UI Concept/Design . The ASCII value in picture should be change based off of the bits in evaluation you are doing. Bits displayed, label, and evaluation would be specific to evaluation type: Original ASCII . Color Codes . Pixels are little dots on Monitors and TVs that make up the display. Each pixel has an Red Green and Blue value (RGB). All pictures we see or take are composed of RGB using a density measurement. These are stored and then represented by digitally or in print. .

Designing an algorithm often requires you to learn the Tech first and then consider how you design your code and algorithms. Code design can take many iterations. . Truth Tables . My topic for this blog is Truth Tables. The illustration that follows displays the results of logical operators AND, OR, XOR, NOT versus binary 1 and 0. The output produces a &#39;Truth Table&#39;. . . Exploring Truth Tables operations . Exploration of this topic requires searching the language for logical operators, then figuring out how to display condition and test result. . Bitwise operations for Truth Tables typically represent 1 - True and 0 - False. | Logical expression in iteration and selection statements result in True or False | . My objective is Truth Tables. But in my exploration I did both Truth Table and Expression syntax . print(&quot;OR&quot;) print( &quot;1 | 0 = &quot;, 1 | 0) print( &quot;~(1 | 0) = &quot;, ~(1 | 0) % 2) # 1 is an integer, not a bit so remainder (modulo) does trick print(&quot;AND&quot;) print( &quot;1 &amp; 0 = &quot;, 1 &amp; 0) print( &quot;~(1 &amp; 0) = &quot;, ~(1 &amp; 0) % 2) # modulo again print(&quot;XOR&quot;) print( &quot;1 ^ 1 = &quot;, 1 ^ 1) print() # Boolean Tests print(&quot;Boolean OR&quot;) print( &quot;True or False = &quot;, True or False) print(&quot;Boolean AND&quot;) print( &quot;True and False = &quot;, True and False) print(&quot;Boolean XOR&quot;) print( &quot;True != True = &quot;, True != True) .

This algorithm focuses on small reusable procedures/functions (def) for bitwise tests. From the exploratory experience above it seems like a lot of typing would be necessary to represent possibilities. . import operator # functions for all comparisons, logical operations, mathematical operations and sequence operations # builds truth table def truth_options(): a_opts = [1, 0] b_opts = [1, 0] return [(a, b) for a in a_opts for b in b_opts] # double for permutes options # provides equivalent function lookup for bitwise using operator functions def bitwise_options(op): ops = {&#39;&amp;&#39;: operator.and_, &#39;|&#39;: operator.or_, &#39;^&#39;: operator.xor} return ops[op] # control/eval for bitwise operators, selection is based on number of operators def bitwise_eval(op, op2=&quot;&quot;): if op2 == &quot;&quot;: op_func = bitwise_options(op) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{a} {op} {b} is {op_func(a, b)}&quot;) else: op2_func = bitwise_options(op2) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{op}({a} {op2} {b}) is {(1, 0)[op2_func(a, b)]}&quot;) # opposite: index 0 returns 1, index 1 return 0 def method1(): bitwise_eval(&quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NAND&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NOR&quot;, &quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;^&quot;) # call bitwise evaluation of truth table if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: print(&quot;***** Method 1 *****&quot;) method1() . ***** Method 1 ***** Bitwise &amp; 1 &amp; 1 is 1 1 &amp; 0 is 0 0 &amp; 1 is 0 0 &amp; 0 is 0 Bitwise NAND NAND(1 &amp; 1) is 0 NAND(1 &amp; 0) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 1) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 0) is 1 Bitwise | 1 | 1 is 1 1 | 0 is 1 0 | 1 is 1 0 | 0 is 0 Bitwise NOR NOR(1 | 1) is 0 NOR(1 | 0) is 0 NOR(0 | 1) is 0 NOR(0 | 0) is 1 Bitwise ^ 1 ^ 1 is 0 1 ^ 0 is 1 0 ^ 1 is 1 0 ^ 0 is 0 . Truth Table - Algorithm 2 . This algorithm above seemed to me to lose clarity with all the functions.

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs. This code works off of the server endpoint/url, not from code cells above it in this notebook. . To work with this code and make observation for learning... .

TPC/IP messages are broken up into small independent “packets” and sent between computers via the Internet. . | IP is responsible for “routing” each packet to the correct destination. When an IP packet is sent from a computer, it arrives at an IP router. The IP router is responsible for “routing” the packet to the correct destination, directly or via another router. . | . | Network Layer - The wireless and physical layers that move bits and bytes “11010001” across the internet. . | . . Fault Tolerence . College Board . Know how to determine if vertex of graph has more than one connection. Multiple connections, in reference to a computing device, could be considered “Fault Tolerant”. Building “Fault Tolerant” systems makes the network or internet stronger. . Understanding Computer, Routers, Systems, and Purpose are a pre-requisite to understanding Fault Tolerance systems. Regarding College Board videos, for clarification, a Router is typically used to connect computers. Here is an illustration that is very similar to the key components we have used in this class and should be familiar to those who have done deployment. | . As we are at school, using an HTTP client we request a page via LAN or Campus Network. This Network has a router and an ISP router that directs us to the public internet. | DNS is used to translate https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com to an IP address, see What’s My DNS | This targets the Web Server, the request is directed through a router to the Server running Nginx, which intern directs request to Gunicorn application hosting the Flask Website. | . Fault tolerant “routing” and “systems” on the internet is achieved by having redundancy in routing paths and computer functions. Networks and Systems become stronger because of many routes and redundancy of function. This AWS picture shows load balancing, multiple zones, redundant equipment, standby and fail over equipment and paths. This is much more than just having multiple connections, there is A LOT of planning in making fault tolerance. This is why there is such a rise in companies like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc. | . . The path the TCP/IP packet will follow might be different from other packets, for instance from the same HTTP communication. The routers in the network are responsible for the right addressing, depending on traffic volume, errors in the network, etc. Since the Internet is Fault Tolerant, there are many paths to a destination, similar to Google Maps providing alternate paths when we travel. Time can be seen with Ping. Routes and time can be see with TraceRoute command… | .

            "content": "What Are VPN’s? . Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs establish a protected network connection when using public networks. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data. . How Does A VPN Work . A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data. This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online, and which can only be accessed if one’s VPN gets hacked; however, that is extremely unlikely to happen because VPN’s are very securely encrypted. A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into “gibberish”. Even if someone were to get their hands on your data, it would be useless. . Setting Up A VPN (MacOS) . Navigate to your browser and search for a VPN and follow the websites directions for installation | Go to “System Preferences” and then “Network” | Click on the plus sign in the bottom left corner and use the drop-down menu to choose your VPN | Fill in the details for your chosen VPN in the fields “VPN Type” and “Service Name” | Create a new VPN network and fill in your “Server Address,” “Remote ID” and “Local ID” | Enter “Authentication Settings” and add your username and password | Click “OK” and Connect your VPN | Setting Up A VPN (Windows) .

            "content": "Deployment Overview . Deploying a Web Application enables a Server and Web Application to be available to users on the Internet. Development Operations (DevOps) is understanding the tools and service used to enable the Web Application on the Internet. This process can use many different cloud services, as well as choice of many different tools. Here is an overview of what is covered in this procedure. . EC2: Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that the PUSD district has provided for their students to serve our Web Application. | GitHub: The leading open platform to share a code across the Internet. | Docker and docker-compose: Used to host a Web Application. A Docker container prepares an environment that contains the Web Application code and all the dependencies (requirements.txt for Python) Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. | Nginx: In order to find a Web Application on a server, there needs to be a process that listens for the Web Application request and directs it to the Web Application service. Nginx is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. | Certbot: Web traffic on internet is reliably served over Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (https). Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Let’s Encrypt certifications. | DNS: Natively, the web works off of IP addresses. Domain Name Services (DNS) allows the assignment of a friendly name to a Web Server. This name is built into Nginx/Certbot configuration files. Freenom is the cloud service described in this blog and has been used to register the nighthawkcodingsociety.com domain. | . Key/Values required as you go through these procedures . Listed are Keys, you need to obtain “values” specific to your Web Application setup. It is important that you recognize the sample “values” as you work through these procedures, then replace them with the “values” that are specific to your Web Application use case. . GitHub HTTPS link: | IAM user: | EC2 name: | EC2 Public IPs: | DNS Name: | DNS Subdomain name(s) | Docker Port: | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: | docker-compose, docker Image name: | Nginx server file(s): | . Server Setup and Initial Deployment . Development Operations (DevOps) begins with server setup. . Amazon Web Services (AWS): Electric Cloud Compute (EC2) Setup . Preparing and AWS EC2 instance is the process of creating a cloud computer. This process starts by logging into your AWS IAM user, searching for EC2. . To get started, launch a new AWS EC2 instance to learn process and understand how to work with Linux. here are some key considerations. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the class will be using Ubuntu you should check on last verified version with a Teacher before proceeding | When it comes to picking memory or disk it is VERY important to pick Free Tier. As stated, this will only be used for testing and then it will be disposed for cost efficiency. | When presented with access dialog for http and https, make sure you check these boxes. Remember you are making a Web application that will run over http and https. | Name the security group (.pem) file after your self or team. It may be necessary to use SSH to access your EC2 instance. | The remainder of the steps you can use the defaults, refer to AWS documentation for guidance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html | At the end of this process you need to “Connect to Instance”. This will provide you a terminal like experience. | . | . Deployment Process . Deployment begins with terminal connections. It is necessary to run commands to setup files to enable your Web Application to run on the Internet. . Connect to EC2 through cloud . Connect to an Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS and then begin the system and software setup. . Select your machine and press “Connect” at top middle. | On next screen ensure things are lined “EC2 Instance Connect” and press “Connect” at bottom. | Only if this fails you will need to connect from our Anaconda terminal, we need pem file so place it in your home directory. | Either connection should work at home, school WIFI may be blocking, I have been trying to get this open. A Hot spot or VPN will solve connection errors. | . Update, Upgrade, and Install packages . Terminal commands are shown, these commands will be run from Terminal after you connect to your EC2 instance. It is advised that you try to comprehend and learn these commands as you go through these procedures. Understanding steps is how you become a DevOps Engineer. . These commands update and then upgrade packages in your system. . $ sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade $ sudo apt install docker $ sudo apt install docker-compose -y $ sudo apt install html2text $ sudo apt install python3-pip nginx $ sudo pip3 install virtualenv . Clone and Change Directory to project location . This command moves your Web Application code onto you EC2 cloud computer. The example GithUb HTTPs Link is demonstration is: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git. . $ cd $ git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git $ cd flask_portfolio . Clone needs to be repeated for each Web application on the EC2 instance (Team repository and each individual repository). If repo is named the same use option parameter at the end of clone command git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git flask_portfolio_john, then cd flask_portfolio_john | . Test Web Service . These steps will require you to understand a few new commands that will not be part of final deployment process. However, these commands will help you understand machine dependencies and validate your requirements.txt for completeness. . $ cd ~/flask_portfolio $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 webapp $ source webapp/bin/activate $ pip install -r requirements.txt $ python main.py . Failed result. If you get a result that looks like the below, your requirements.txt needs work. In this instance, I would need to add flask to the requirements.txt. | .

Create Dockerfile to run Web Service . A Dockerfile is a configuration used to run the Web Service. This is placed in a file called Dockerfile. It is best to add this to VS Code and pull it, or you can update in place with nano, vi, or vim editor and use command line commands to push it into your repository. The Dockerfile should be considered Code! . Edit the Dockerfile $ sudo nano Dockerfile . | Insert the Dockerfile commands, note that they are similar to Bash commands performed earlier.

Create docker-compose file share Web Service . A docker-compose file is a configuration used to share your Docker Web Service and resources with the Linux system. This file enable Linux to have access to the container and the persistent data application via the /volumes location. . Once again it is best to add the docker-compose.yml in VS Code and pull it. You can edit it on the machine itself using vi, vim, or nano. | The image: needs to have unique name for each application on server (ie flask_john_v1) | The ports: left value 8086 needs to be unique for each application on server (ie 8087:8080, 8088:8080, etc) | Change device: to match path to volumes directory of your project.

Here is a look at some of the commands behind the scenes. None of these are required to get things working, but show the results of the Docker and docker-compose.yml files and commands. . docker-compose ps View the running Web process, “ps” is a linux command or option that provides information related to the processes on a system. Look at name and ports in relation to outputs of the docker-compose process and settings in docker-compose.yml file. $ sudo docker-compose ps Name Command State Ports -- flask_portfolio_web_1 gunicorn main:app Up 0.0.0.0:8086-&gt;8080/tcp,:::8086-&gt;8080/tcp . | docker ps View a more comprehensive list of all the docker processes on the system.

If you are to this point you are successfully running your Web Application with Docker and verifying that it is running with Curl. | . Test preparation for Docker Web Application using IP for Internet Access . Each student scrum team will perform Nginx test and verify Group Web Project is working on EC2 instance. This step is can only support a single Web Application at a time. . This Step is dependent on… . EC2 Public IPs: 3.233.212.71 | Docker Port: 8086 | . Enable Nginx to retrieve default Web Application using IP Address from internet request (Reverse Proxy)! . Install Nginx on Ubuntu servers $ sudo apt install nginx . | Go to location of Nginx server configuration files $ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available . | Open editor to Create your own “Nginx test configuration”. $ sudo nano test . | Edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications to: IP Address: 3.233.212.71 | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8086 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name 3.233.212.71; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8086; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } .

This means something is wrong with EC2 Public IP. | Nginx Default page. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with you Nginx test configuration. | Broken Gateway. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with Web Application endpoint on machine. This requires you to look at port configuration OR restart Docker. | . | . Congratulations. If you have arrived at this point you now have capability to access your team Web Application from the Internet. Hurray!!! . Final preparation the Docker Web Application using DNS for Internet Access . There are additional steps to this preparation. We need to direct the internet to the AWS server running the Web Application, this is done using Domain Name Service (DNS). After being directed to the Web Server, the server needs to respond to the HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) request. The proxy of HTTP to your Web Application is manged by Nginx. Finally, we will Secure HTTP (HTTPS), with a utility called Certbot. . DNS provider and setup . Each student scrum team is required to learn how to obtain a DNS provider and setup an independent domain. . A picture is included to show key elements in setting up a domain with a DNS provider. The nighthawkcodingsociety.com is using Freenom as its service provider. As you build your own DNS endpoint, you will need to obtain your own IP address mapped to a Domain. . This Freenom illustration is dependent on… . DNS Name: nighthawkcodingsociety.com | DNS Subdomain name(s): battleship.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. cowboys.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | . A minimum configuration will have the two “A” type definitions using you Public IP address. These two are resolved with a single Web Application. The “CNAME” type is used for subdomains, these will resolve to a different Web Application. . Setup DNS mapping to your Public IP address now!!! This is needed to complete Nginx and Certbot configurations below. You will not be able to proceed until you have setup ‘A’ record. . . Open editor to Create your own “Nginx Web Application configuration” for your group project. This looks very similar to test configurations, but the change is the Domain names. These Domain names must be created through DNS provider and you must setup ‘A’ entries in DNS for them to work. For clarity, the name nighthawk should reflect your application name, domain or subdomain. The name needs to be unique for each web application (ie john_nighthawk for john.nighthawk.com). $ sudo nano nighthawk . | Edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications: DNS Name(s): nighthawkcodingsociety.com www.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8086 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name nighthawkcodingsociety.com www.nighthawkcodingsociety.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8086; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } . Or, or in addition, edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications to subdomain file (0 to many). These Domain names must be created through DNS provider and you must setup ‘A’ or ‘CNAME’ entries in DNS for them to work: DNS Name(s): flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8087 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8087; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } .

Testing HTTP endpoint . Before finishing, this is a good opportunity to review everything you have done. . Make sure curl is still working on local machine. | . $ curl http://localhost:8086 $ curl http://localhost:8087 etc . Now test unsecure HTTP endpoint on the internet. Go to a browser anywhere and type your DNS domain: http://nighthawkcodingsociety.com or http://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. Timeout. This means something is wrong with EC2 Public IP. | Nginx Default page. This means DNS is working, but something is wrong with you Nginx configuration. | Broken Gateway. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with Web Application endpoint on machine, if this fails something is wrong with Web Application. This requires you to look at Docker and docker-compose configuration. | . | . Certbot install and configuration . Each student scrum team will learn Certbot on on AWS EC2 test server, establish working https web application.

            "content": ". GitHub and Git . GitHub.com was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chaco. GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018 (kind of ironic with Git quote below), but GitHub is not Git it helps manage the server or backend. . Linus Torvalds invented Linux and about 2005 invented Git. Quotes by Linus: . “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” | “Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.” | Microsoft isn’t evil; they just make really crappy operating systems. | . In our environments, Git is local and it works with GitHub/Git is in the cloud. Together these tools together have become an industry standard since about 2015. Formerly in industry we used tools like (ClearCase and Perforce), before the 90s we had home brewed systems. Kind of like making smart backups of files. . Terms and Usage . A brief review of key commands and concepts. . A “git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git). | A .git directory contains a local database (see illustration) that keeps track of local changes. | A “git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database. Git commits over time are a series of Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA’s). This is the math behind a git snapshot. | The .gitignore file tells .git to ignore certain files in directory tree (ie files constructed from source or derived files, like ipynb files that turn into md files). | The “git push” command moves files from local system back to cloud server (GitHub). However, often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors. Students will experience this when they share a repository. | To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud. This simply delays the inevitable merge, but has benefit of keeping developers branch of project stable. | Pull requests is common process used to merge code from isolated Fork back to the primary GitHub repository. | A “git rebase” is a common command for Developer on an isolated Git branch to update their environment from the “main” branch. Often this is done prior to a “git push” back the “main” branch. | . Project Based Learning . In Project Based Learning, it is required that you have a policy on Contributing Guidelines. Many student have already experienced problems of merging and managing change, by editing code GitHub directly, while editing code on VSCode locally. This will be an every day occurrence when starting a GitHub/Git sociology. Thus, teams need to create a policy to communicate how Scrum Team or Others should contribute to your project. . GitHub and VSCode | . Hacks . Any sociology questions within team need to be answered with a Blog, A Scrum Master working with other Developers should establish the Github administration/sociology policies: . What is the main repository for your project? | Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control? Look at this tool for guidance. | Do you have a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies introduced to your Code Base? | Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? Creating Issues | Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? Create Pull Request | Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests? Link Issue to PR | Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban? Tracking Issues | .",

Project Planning . Teacher/Student need, Educational Study or Simulation, Campus Club, Campus Interest, Business Interest, Charitable Organization, etc. Of course, the greatest interest is Student Interest. The project will not work if only one student is interested. - Program Purpose and Function. Think about inputs, outputs, UI, and data that will be in the program. - Be sure to pick something that you don’t burn out on after a couple of weeks. If you are a couple days into something and it is not working it is best to change. - IMO, it is much more interesting to work on something that has 3rd party interest or that you design something with intention to acquire a 3rd party interest. Working on something to acquire accolades is a big motivator. . Begin a GitHub code base with Team. Some of ideation may come in playing with code. This could also be done in Jupyter Notebooks. | Data Abstraction. UML is pictured in article. Think about how data will be formed and managed. | Managing Complexity. Think about frontend and backend portions of the system. | Procedural Abstraction. Design some of the key objects of the system. Think about the key elements of User Design. This should help you divide work amongst team. Effectually, you will be creating the sub systems of the system in this design effort. | Algorithm Implementation. The key aspects of your project and its algorithms must be considered, prototyped early. This will help you understand capabilities of team and some of the longer/research required activities. | Testing. Be sure that you are performing iteration and testing as you go. Do not stack things up or integrate infrequently. Develop, Integrate, Test weekly!!! Also, think about the things that needs to be tested. Think about how to put data into the system auto magically to ensure quality is produced and everything is easily validated. | . Teacher Needs . PBL. Concept/Idea in CSP Education.

W3Schools - reference | feecodecamp.org - pbl . | javascript30.com - pbl . | . console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher); // before role logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // ok to do this even though role is not yet defined // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // set the role logItType(teacher); logItType(teacher.toJSON()); . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;&#34;} object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

            "content": "Agile Methodology . . Agile software development uses practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints. Agile includes the 12 Principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. . . Roles . To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a standup meeting for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment. . Scrum Master: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. | DevOps: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies (requirements.txt), AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity. | Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presenters, developers, etc. Two key roles in Web Development are … Frontend Developer: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. | Backend Developer: Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. | . | . Workload . When planning there is an expectation of time. . Individual in Class Time. You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week. | Individual at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time. | Sprint Calculation Time. 5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team. If we had a two week Sprint this would be 40-48 hours of work. | Key to success. Make great use of time in class. Pair share programming typically provides three time dividend over individual programming when in class and you are learning something new. | . Issues . Sprint cadences have ideas/issues that are broken into short term work units called tasks. . Scrum Board / GitHub Project / Kanban Style . The Scrum Board contains issues that are assigned to individuals, each of these issues will have tangible deliverable links (code/video/…). Scrum Team will use Scrum Board to understand everyone’s ideas and efforts. This includes individual tasks. Use GitHub Projects add Issues to the board. Issues are placed in columns on a Scrum Board (Kanban) to represent progress. The below columns have been successful in our academic environment. . To do/backlog | In progress | Complete | Deployed | Reviewed/Done | Sprint . Sprint is a period of time that Team uses to plan work and execute work. This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. Typically, sprints will be 2 weeks or longer in the classroom. Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there will be a weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Review Ticket (summative assessment). Sample sprint follows… . Week 1 Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | Week 2 Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . 7 Important Transferable Skills . Assessments / Reviews . During Teacher reviews meetings ( 1 v 2 pair, 1 v 4 team), the pair or team will provide Teacher with a Review Ticket. The Review Ticket will be completed, it should reference Tasks Completed and Self/Crossover Score(s). Canvas and/or Points Blog should be used as a guide to completing a review ticket, make sure you account for everything. Make sure a Point total is a the TOP of ticket, as points are important to you! All assessments will be looking for these 7 elements in your work… . Creativity Creativity doesn’t necessarily mean you paint or draw or sculpt well. Creativity in education and workplace, in many cases, presents itself in terms of how you approach tasks and solve problems, Do you do both inside and outside of the box for solutions? Or, do you stick to a planned system? If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled up are big problems. Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical thinking Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking, especially when the problems are critical. Not only that, but critical thinking skills also enable the discovery of deficiencies that could cause less than optimal results. The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. If you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | Collaboration - Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research. Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . | Technical We live in a tech-heavy world, and you need to understand the tech your project requires. Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. Make sure that play with the different softwares and platforms that are part of your environment.

            "content": "It’s often useful to test pages locally before deploying, as it can save time and be helpful for testing quick changes/debugging. In this blog we’ll learn how to deploy fastpages locally using Docker. . Overview of steps . Download Docker desktop | (For Windows) Set up Docker with WSL | Run make server in repo directory | Click in terminal or type localhost link show (ex. http://127.0.0.1:4000/{repo name}) to view your Fastpages Blog site. | 1. Installation . Docker is a lightweight method to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers. Download Docker desktop from following links: . Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/. . Now, each time you want to make server, you need to start Docker desktop or make sure it running. Make sure you do this before building locally! . 2. (For Windows) Set up Docker with WSL . For Windows, to set up Docker with WSL use https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/. . (Optional) Download Docker extension in VSCode . VSCode has an extension too make it easier to manage docker containers and images directly in your IDE. To download, go to the Extensions tab of VSCode (left bar, or Ctrl+Shift+X), search “Docker” and download the extension from Microsoft. You should now see a docker icon on the left bar, which you can click on to see your Docker connections. . 3. Using VSCode Terminal, run: make server . In the local repository, make sure you are cd’ed to the base/root directory (i.e. where the Makefile is). For Ellen that was the ap-csa-fastpages directory as pictured. For Mr M, cd ~/vscode/APCSA sets him in his APCSA repository, here the make server command will work if Docker is running. . . The Makefile contains common aliased commands for building and serving your fastpages locally. If you look inside the file or run make in terminal, you can see what docker commands it can run. . . Specifically, we are interested in the make server command, which will build the container the first time and start the Jekyll server. If you remember from APCSP, Jekyll is what powers Github pages behind the scenes. You can build your GitHub Pages site locally using Jekyll to preview and test changes to your site. . Special steps for Windows . The first time, you might get this issue: . . If that’s the case, make sure this setting is toggled on in Docker desktop settings: . . It should ask you to reload and if you run the command again it should work now. . 4. View blog . After running, look for link to run Server. For me, this was http://127.0.0.1:4000/{repo name}: . Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/ . Server running… press ctrl-c to stop. . Shift-click server address to launch in Browser. . Leave the server running!!! . Make edits in VSCode and save the file. On each save, watch terminal in VSCode to see updates and regeneration of WebSite. . Refresh or click to Web page of change and you will see updates almost instantly. Refer to VSCode terminal to see any error encountered when running your server. As indicated ctrl-c will stop the server, however, I have left it running for hours of edits, testing, and commits to GitHub. . Alert, when you are satisfied with local changes… you must ✔️Commit and Sync to GitHub. The local server is used to preview and test change prior to Sync. Only after Sync, will others be able to see your changes. . . Add to .gitignore . A side effect of building locally is that it converts all the .ipynb and .docx files to .md.

Laurie Santos is a professor at Yale has produced one of the most popular classes of all time at Yale (1 of 4 students take this class). . Teacher Notes . In my first watch of this video, right after 2021-2022 school year, these were my observations in improving the well being of Computer Science at Del Norte. . The Teacher needs to reduce academic stress on students. | The Teacher needs to convince Students to form habits of successful people, as discussed in the video. These habits need to be formed collaboratively between Teacher and Student. | Students need to strive to form an attitude of success for life. This takes effort and commitment. Similar to exercise analogies discussed in video. | In active discussions with Ms Naidu who taught at Del Norte in 2021-2022, we determined the biggest weakness in students our students is Collaboration, not Technical. | Laure Santos request that students be grateful for their current situation. | . Teacher Message . The AP Computer Science classes at Del Norte in 2022-2023 is structured to do most of the work in the classroom. Students, please prioritize the 4C habits: Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking and Creativity in classroom. Additionally, focus, ask questions, Code/Code/Code, and make mistakes. If you do these things, you are in danger of getting 90% on all your assignments. . Agile and Psychology of the Good Life . A lot of the methods in Agile, Sprints, and Scrums are helping to establish habits and focus. As Engineers, we need to learn to put concepts together! . Habit helpers: Stand-up meetings, Issues, Scrum Board, Review Tickets, Sprints | Focus helpers: Reviewing Issues, Pair Coding, Making mistakes, Fixing Bugs, Scrum accountability | Look at my interpretation of students history over the years. How could habits apply to you and your team(s) through 2023? | . Hacks . Watch and build a vocabulary about how to use the “Psychology and the Good Life” and maintain it on GH Pages.

            "content": "EXAM PREPARATION . TAKE THE NOTES! I know the Collegeboard videos are not the most interesting thing and a lot of them cover topics you may already know from class, but just taking simple notes may come in handy when you need to review towards the end of the tri. Also taking notes is very helpful for remembering overall concepts which means LESS REVIEW NEEDED LATER! | TRY ON THE QUIZZES AND PRACTICE TESTS! They are great practice, and searching up the answers is definitely not the way to go. | QUIZ AND TEST CORRECTIONS! They are a great way from you to learn the information if you didn’t learn it from the video. | BUT MOST HELPFUL (FOR ME)…Khan Academy Videos! I found that these videos were super helpful when I needed to review something really fast, but didn’t want to go to collegeboard. I really thought the videos/assignments on the internet were very effective for me. I think its a great resource to use just to review the topics that you are super confused or just want more clarification about. . They’re videos are super quick and straight to the point, which was good for relearning topics I already knew but needed a refresh on. For example, bits and binary was something that I couldn’t remember from the beginning of the year, and the videos helped me remember the basics. | They have assignments/articles for each topic that basically restate the information in the videos but more visually. The unit that covered data security and encryption is a good example of combining the videos and articles, and they definitely helped me understand public and private keys more. | Their practices are also pretty quick and straightforward if you are looking for extra resources other than the quizzes and practice tests. I used the practice tests about the internet because that was something I was not understanding just from Collegeboard practice. | . | THE EXAM . PAY ATTENTION TO THE QUESTIONS ON THE PRACTICE TESTS! The questions are very similar to what is on the exam. If you know them from the practice exam then you can save up on time from checking your work after you finish. | STARTING TIMING YOUR PRACTICE TESTS! The ones we were given in class were 50 questions. Once you get the hang of the first couple of practice tests, start giving yourself around a hour or an hour and a half to finish all 50 questions. This is gonna help you with pacing and with working under the pressure. | TAKE YOUR TIME! The test is 2 hours for 70 MC. You have time to double and even triple check your answers if you work at a good pace. With that being said don’t stress about not having enough time because you definitely do. | CREATE TASK TIPS . READ OVER THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY! Make sure that you are including each specific element in your project. It might be helpful to make a checklist with everything and check each item off as you are completing it with your project. I found myself having to review the guidelines a lot because there would be little things that I was forgetting, but doing so definitely made my project stronger. | REVIEW THE PAST EXAMPLES FROM COLLEGEBOARD! Seeing what ideas got lower scores guided me and I knew what to avoid including in my own project. Additionally, the good examples gave me some ideas of how other people included the required lists, iteration, and other items in a creative way. Though these examples might inspire you, make sure that you are coming up with your own idea and not directly copying. I looked at example A and B because those examples got all the points rewarded, so I looked at those for what to include and how much to write for my response. | I looked specifically at examples I and H because they both lost a bunch of points, so I made sure not look at what they did wrong and fix those error in my response. | . | CITE YOUR SOURCES! If you use code from somewhere else, dont forget to make notes throughout giving credit to the original creator. Even something as small as a loop needs to be cited if its from somewhere else. But definitely try to code everything yourself because it’s good practice and you learn a lot through actually working through the bugs in your project. | DON’T MAKE A BASIC GAME! This one is more subjective, but a lot of people were telling me that if you make something basic/generic like hangman or tic tac toe you are not going to get a good score. I think just try to be as creative as possible and make sure that your project has a geniune purpose because that’s an important part of the create task. Also please don’t do a GPA Calculator, its so overdone :) | REVIEW THE SCORING GUIDELINES! Don’t just assume you are meeting each requirement, check the guidelines. They let you know exactly what they are looking for, so its another great way to double check your work. | CODE IT ALL AT ONCE THEN REVIEW EACH SECTION! This is also more subjective, but I found it super helpful to code a basic idea of what my create task would look like and all the functionality in one sitting. Then as the deadline approached, I spent a day working through each sections, adding new functionality that reflected the requirements, and refining the code I already created to be more effcient. This was more helpful for me because I had way more time to refine the code and make it way better than that initial draft. | ADD COMMENTS TO THE CODE AS YOU GO! This is something that I wish I did because I ended up forgetting until the last days before the submission. It was not fun having to organize my code and add comments to each line right before the deadline. Adding comments to each section after you write the code is definitely ideal because you can remember exactly what the purpose is. | SPEND A DAY REARRANGING THE CODE! This was important for me because the order that my code was in only made sense to me. But obviously I’m not the one grading, so I spent time going through and arranging my code in a way that I thought would make sense to a random person going through it line by line. | MY CREATE TASK PROCESS LINKS .

Each time we engage in Code/Code/Coding it is an opportunity to think of the possibility of fulfilling the Create Performance Task requirement. But, this is a student project and responsibility is on you. To be thinking and preparing is a mindset, one that Del Norte CompSci Teachers advise as we proceed through topics. Thus, we are getting and early start by using this Pair Share project as an iteration through the entire process, as that is the foundational principle behind PBL. . Teacher will help as directed by College Board… . Provide instruction, practice, and feedback related to content and skills that will help students succeed on the performance task. This can include, but needs not be limited to, the iterative development process, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithm’s purpose and explaining how it functions. | Brainstorm problems that programming can address or brainstorm special interests that students want to incorporate when developing a program. | Assist students in defining their focus and choice of topics without making selections for them (e.g., by asking questions). | Review the performance task directions and provide multiple opportunities to practice and discuss the entire performance task and individual prompts of the task. | Explain the role the teacher can and cannot play in providing students with assistance during the actual performance task; teachers should encourage students to take advantage of the opportunity to get assistance and feedback from teachers and peers during practice. | Review the scoring guidelines with students to help them understand how their work will be assessed. Teachers should remind students that the scoring guidelines align to the prompts in the performance task, so they must respond to all the prompts in their attempt to obtain the highest score possible. | . Disclaimer. Del Norte Computer Science Teachers are not experts in College Board scoring guidelines. It is best to look for examples of performance task submissions at high, medium, and low levels on College Board Web Site. Any grades you receive on any project in class may differ from scoring of the performance task by College Board. . General Requirements, from CB Exam Description . Prior to the official administration of the Create performance task, students need practice implementing programs that first include sequencing, then incorporate selection and iteration, and finally use procedures and lists. While collaboration on ideation and program design and development during the Create performance task is not required, it is encouraged. . You will be provided with a minimum of 12 hours of class time to complete and submit the following: . Final program code (created independently or collaboratively) | A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently) | Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task (created independently) | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers are requiring students to do collaborative ideation, program design, prototyping and pair programming on these early activities that we grade in class. . Create Performance Task Skills and Rubric Breakdown (Out of 6 Points) . Note: There is no partial credit (0 or 1 point for each section). AP Computer Science Principles Exam is a through-course performance task that assesses Computational Thinking Practices 1, 2, 3, and 4 across six rubric rows. . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . Assesses students’ ability to explain how a code segment or program functions.

Assesses students’ ability to investigate the situation, context,or task. (Skill Computational Solution Design - testing) | . Collaboration Rules, from CB Q&amp;A . Collaboration happens when two or more students are actively engaged in the development of a program. Some examples of acceptable ways to collaborate are as follows. . 2 students who are writing the entire program together, perhaps using pair programming. | 2 or more students who have divided a larger, more complex program into different separate parts, each writing their own part and then assembling the pieces into the finished program. | Student(s) giving feedback on an independently or collaboratively written program. | Student(s) providing debugging assistance to another student or collaborative group of students. | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers want to see all of these prescribe methods of collaboration utilized. . Collaboration without Plagiarism, from CB Q&amp;A . If students are combining independently written program code with another student, they should cite that the program code is written by a collaborative peer. To protect the anonymity of the collaborative peer, students simply state that the portion of program code was written by their collaborative peer, rather than putting the names of themselves or their collaborative peer in the program code. . When completing the Create performance task, students will need to add substantial revisions and additional functionality when starting with preexisting program code. Simply changing an image in a game or the names of variables is insufficient. . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers have zero tolerance for plagiarism. Misrepresenting your own work and not attending class (without makeup) are the only ways to get less than 70% in the class. Plagiarism is 0%, being in class is 50%, any individual effort with attendance gets 70%. The biggest jeopardy to getting a bad grade in the class is getting a 0%, the only possibility of such is plagiarism or missing class without makeup. .

Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. Or in other words, something that is easier for the developer to understand. Data Abstraction, along with Procedural Abstraction, are the keys making successful programs. Data Abstraction is vital when sharing data amongst developers, sharing data across the internet, or working in technologies like BioMed, Data Science, etc. . Variables are a way to name, store, data and reference data. We have started working with variables in our last sprint. Lists and Dictionaries are variables with extended features for storing and retrieving data.

In our Fastpages/GitHub Pages a lot of the frontend design work has been done by using Fastpages and Minima theme. Jekyll takes our choice of layouts in our _config.yml file (theme: minima), along with our HTML and Markdown fragments and build a complete static website. . Review these Fragments . Table Fragments . In Fastpages you can build a table in HTML or Markdown. Building in markdown allows you to take advantage of Jekyll. . The index.html does markdown conversion and builds a table with blogs | The _posts/**pseudo_code.md file builds a table with Markdown | . Images . In Fastpages you can insert images in HTML or Markdown. The Teacher finds &lt;img&gt; easier to work with for embedding links when trying to control size. . See index.html for “img” usage | Lookup ![]() syntax for images in markdown guides | . Links . Look up &lt;href&gt; and []() syntax in both HTML and Markdown. These should become easy and familiar. .

The greater coding system we use is GitHub Pages which uses Jekyll and Liquid to build and programmatically construct fragments into the larger web site. categories: [weeks] title: Week 2 - HTML Fragments . Web Page Layout . A complete HTML Web Application is typically made off of a Layout and a series of Fragments (sometimes called templates). . Web Page Layout. This illustration becomes important when you make your own layout and fragments using frameworks like Jinja2 (for Python) or Thymeleaf (for Java). | The design of GitHub pages allows us to change themes with the _config.yml file (theme: minima) key/value, change the value to a supported theme. But, on my tries it does not work because fastpages has added many features specific to minima. However, you can temporarily change to different look by changing the remote theme to the following location in your _config.yml | Minima theme, click on link for accurate syntax. Everywhere you see an “include” this layout is including a fragment to complement the page, things like CSS, JavaScript, headers and footers are included into the layout. Where you see “content”, this is the statement that includes page specific fragments we have designed added within the layout. You should associate all of this to “Procedural Abstraction”. | . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &quot;include head.html&quot; &lt;body&gt; &quot;include header.html&quot; &lt;main class=&quot;page-content&quot; aria-label=&quot;Content&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; &quot;content&quot; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/main&gt; &quot;include footer.html&quot; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . Dark Mode . I have seen several student customize CSS on their front page. This enables them to add color. In our fastpages project, there is a special way to customize. Look for the direct _sass, it has a minima folder. Inside this directory you will see many sccs files, this is the Sassy of customize your project. . Article and findings by Vunsh in CSA to customize to Darkmode | People have customized the dark-mode.scss file to alternate color schemes for different colors, for instance instead of black, I saw Saathvicka change to dark green | . Alert to Students . Students spending majority or large portions of time writing custom CSS will be counter productive to College Board goals and CTE goals for this class. Be aware that HTML style is important, but we are trying to focus more on utilizing framework (GitHub Pages) to maximize our success in the style area. Developers, particularly new Developers, need to ensure they are spending majority of time in the key technical of instruction.

In our first week, I saw code that was not understood by the person asking questions. In 2021-2022 several students lost a grade (A down to B) at the end of the trimester because they were out of balance and were solely focused on CSS/style. . As an illustration, look at the minima them. Look at the analytics and work that went into it. Leverage off it, don’t recreate it! . Hacks .

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints...

            "title": "Fastpages Frontend Development - Tour of GitHub Pages",
            "content": "Tour of Fastpages . . GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub,runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Fastpages is built on top of GitHub pages. Fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts, so you don’t have to manually run conversion scripts. This tour begins by looking at Explorer in VS Code. There are three automations to a GH Pages / Fastpages website... . _notebooks: jupyter .ipynb files. This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook. | _posts: markdown .md files. This supports frontend web design with markdown, html, and javascript. | _word: word .docx files. This allows you to save Microsoft or Goggle documents into a docx format. Saving these directly to _word folder will streamline steps. | . Read more or review files in the fastpages README.md . . Resources . There are many resources, tutorials, and reference for building pages with HTML and Markdown. On these subjects, I would say learn it when you need it. Right clicking on Chrome provides View Page Source on any link on the Web. The APCSA/APCSP projects have many examples within these projects. Here are a couple of Web links I often find through google or refer to when looking for ideas … . HTML on W3Schools | Markdown Cheat Sheet | . Home Page . The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. GH Pages / Fastpages builds allows you to mix Markdown and HTML within the index.html file. . Sub Pages . Look under _pages folder within the Navigator. In this directory, there are several .md files. These allow a combination of HTML and Markdown. Observe that this project has prefix of 01, 02, 03 on the .md files allows control the order of menus from left to right… . 01_search.md: This provides a very cool search on the site. The search.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 02_tags.md: This provide a very cool tagging system that is related to the “categories: categoryname” that are seen at the top of all the GH Pages / Fastpages _posts. This tags.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 03_about.md: This page is left for your individual customization, similar to index.html | Developers can add .md file of choice and order according to preference. | . Images . Look under images folder and you will see files added to support the site. Some are for customization of the site others are for pages. . Site: favicon.ico, logo.png | Pages: agile.webp, apcsp.png | . GH Pages YAML files . The _config.yml has many strings and preferences that are specific to the site. The file is full of comments that describe what can be changed and what should remain untouched. Note, the .yml files will be seen again as we begin to deploy our own site with Docker. . Hacks . Personalize index.html file and build your own Fastpages / GH Pages for personal use throughout the year. . Add _pages/notes.md or _pages/vocab.md, insert between tags.md and about.md. Use this area to capture idea and terms throughout the year. | Add some personal study or work pages. Consider how you will use these in conjunction with notes/vocab pages, search, and tagging.

Env, Git and GitHub . Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env . cd $project echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;show the secrets of .git&quot; cd .git ls -l echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;look at config file&quot; cat config . Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless).

            "content": "Anthony: Computer Science Before APCSA . Hello! My name is Anthony Vo, and I graduated Del Norte with the class of 2022. . My computer science journey started when I was in second grade. Khan Academy used to have a coding portion of its website, and I remember spending hours making programs that drew simple images. There was no logic involved in the coding, but as an introduction, it got me hooked on the subject. Here&#39;s a recreation of a pig that I made using Khan Academy: . . In elementary school, I used Scratch to create a plethora of games. During the summer, I also took ID Tech Camps that taught me more about game design and programming. Though some of these camps weren&#39;t that helpful in learning computer science (Minecraft mapping isn&#39;t a skill I use to day), they furthered my interest in the subject. You can check out some of my scratch projects here. . I took more computer science classes in middle school with the two GTT classes. The classes still worked a lot with Scratch, but in 8th grade, I learned more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Those classes didn&#39;t result in the best programs, but it provided a solid foundation for problem solving and syntax that I continue to build off of today. Below are a few programs that I made in eighth grade (updated to conform to modern Python standards). . &quot;&quot;&quot;Anthony Vo 11-14-17 coinflip.py To practice using random numbers&quot;&quot;&quot; #Imports random module import random #Initializes variables numberOfHeads = 0 numberOfTails = 0 #Flips coins for number in range(20): coinSide = random.randrange(2) if coinSide == 0: numberOfHeads = numberOfHeads + 1 print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: numberOfTails = numberOfTails + 1 print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Gives result print(f&quot;Overall, heads was flipped {numberOfHeads} times while tails was flipped {numberOfTails} times.&quot;) . Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Heads Heads Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Tails Heads Heads Tails Heads Tails Overall, heads was flipped 5 times while tails was flipped 15 times. . &quot;&quot;&quot;Anthony Vo 11-14-17 fortunecookies.py To practice using random numbers&quot;&quot;&quot; #Imports random module import random #Gives messages whichMessage = random.randrange(5) if whichMessage == 0: print(&quot;You will soon have indigestion due to that fortune cookie.&quot;) elif whichMessage == 1: print(&quot;You will buy more Kung Pao Chicken in the future.&quot;) elif whichMessage == 2: print(&quot;Following this retaurant&#39;s Facebook page will make you prosperous.&quot;) elif whichMessage == 3: print(&quot;If you go to that fake Chinese restaurant Panda Express, you will become poor.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Not eating Chinese cuisine will cause you to have many unlucky days.&quot;) . Following this retaurant&#39;s Facebook page will make you prosperous. . The next computer science class that I took was Mr. Mortensen&#39;s Intro to Computer Science class (which has since been replaced with CSP). This was probably my favorite class in all of high school; hanging out in fifth period with my friends, coding, and having an overall good time was one of the highlights of high school... which probably says something about me ;). I learned how to use GitHub in this class and really collaborate with my peers, which helped me apply my skills to a practical environment. I also learned C which helped me understand more about how computers processed code. Below is a program I made which creates random questions. You can see how much better my programming got after taking this class! . // // main.c // parameterFunctionQuestion(s) // // Created by Vo, Anthony on 9/11/19. // Copyright © 2019 Vo, Anthony.

Anthony: My AP CSA Experience . Finally, we&#39;ve reached junior year. I took AP CSA during the quarantine year, and it helped me improve my Object Oriented Programming skills by a lot. My success in the class stemmed mostly from motivation to code; I spent my first periods coding instead of playing Roblox (which was a popular alternative that I did in my English classes), and I made sure to finish all of my assignments on time without copying from others. Mr. Mortensen&#39;s AP study plan also helped a lot. We were required to finish a CollegeBoard unit quiz every week, so I would hop in a Discord call with my group members every Friday to do the quiz together. I have a lot of fond memories of staying up until 2 AM with my friends on Friday to meet Mr. Mortensen&#39;s assignment deadline (admittedly, it was a lot more fun than it sounds). . For success in AP CSA, I would recommend completing everything on time. Though there is a grace period for a lot of assignments, if you fall behind one week and don&#39;t understand a concept, it can quickly snowball out of control. Get on top of your assignments, make sure you understand each week&#39;s concepts, and you&#39;ll succeed. You don&#39;t need to have had years of prior experience like me; you just need to try your best to understand and work on each week&#39;s work. . After junior year, I realized that I had a big hole in my repretoire. I could code well, sure, but I couldn&#39;t actually present or make anything of substance. So, as I chose senior classes, I decided on CSP to work on my web development skills. I spent the summer writing college essays, playing League of Legends, and hanging out. I also found out that I got a 5 on the AP CSA exam! When fall came, I was ready to begin creating polished websites. During that first trimester, I met a new friend... . Sahil: Starting Out . Hey, I&#39;m Sahil Samar. I&#39;m currently a senior at Del Norte, in the graduating class of 2023. . My computer science journey started out in around 8th grade when I got interested in game development. But game development was a super hard thing to start with! Unity uses a language called C#, and I didn&#39;t have any idea how to use it. I didn&#39;t really understand the architecture of Unity or C# at first; I just kind of dove in and started making projects. I would look up what I didn&#39;t know, and just copy paste in code to get things working. Even this was hard, because when something went wrong I had no idea how to fix it. But with way too many hours, I was able to make some projects. It isn&#39;t easy to get started getting into coding! By the time I got to AP CSP, I still had a lot to learn about the coding mindset. . My very first game, 3D Pong: . . Sahil: AP CSP . When I got to AP CSP, I still didn&#39;t really have an idea of how coding worked. I just knew how to find code and paste it into my project. But slowly, I began moving away from this. I met Anthony Vo, who you just read a little bit about, in my first trimester. Whenever I didn&#39;t understand something, he would always help me out. He wouldn&#39;t give me code to copy paste though. He would actually explain the code to me, so I could do it myself. This was huge for me, since I actually began to think about my code and be able to develop things on my own. Mr. Mortensen guided me through countless problems, but everytime I asked him for help I walked away with some new understanding of how to debug my code. At the start of the trimester, I would go up to Mr. Mortensen or Anthony as soon as I had a problem. But by the end of the year, I only used them as a last resort, after I had truly tried everything. At that point, I just needed a pair of fresh eyes, and not someone to guide me through the whole process. Moral of the story: you aren&#39;t expected to come in an expert at coding! But, if you use your resources properly, you can use this year to grow. You can develop the mindset of a programmer and learn how to create cool projects and debug your issues when things don&#39;t work out. . Sahil: After AP CSP . AP CSP shaped me to be the coder I am today; but you only get out of it what you put into it. If you work hard, then it can completely change your mindset (if you are a new coder), and teach you plenty of skills. After AP CSP, I was able to land a summer internship working in CS at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. During this internship, I worked with huge supercomputers and began to understand what servers really were and how they worked. Our project was called ICICLE. If you want to learn more about it, you could watch this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFk5tDTtoU. I developed sophisticated authentication methods, and did a lot of &quot;firsts&quot; in the project. I went from having to be guided through basic code in CSP to creating things that had never been done before. It&#39;s possible! After doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes, we got to test our system on massive knowledge graphs and run some machine learning algorithms. . Picture of one of the computers I worked with, called Expanse: . . Knowledge Graph of Asteroids, classified using a neural network on being hazarous or not: . . I also never gave up on making games! But now, I don&#39;t really need to follow tutorials anymore. I can architect a solution on my own, and when I do need to look something up I learn from it and implement it rather than just copying it. When something goes wrong, I&#39;m not stuck; I know what to do, and I have confidence because I know that every problem has a solution. Here&#39;s a peek at one of the games I&#39;m working on now: . . Anthony: After CSP . AP CSP helped immensely with my presentation and web development skills. For reference, here&#39;s a website I made for my 10th grade AP European History Final... . . As you can see, it looks like garbage! You can also check out my extremely great 11th grade website for AP CSA here. . After taking AP CSP, my websites looked a lot better. I updated a website for my golf coach and made some personal websites. Here&#39;s a quick one that I made to create basketball teams: . . Even if you&#39;re new to CS as a whole, knowing how to make websites can help you show off the things you&#39;ve done. Whether it&#39;s a personal portfolio website, an online shop, or anything else, web development is a great skill to have. . Final Thoughts . Anthony: I hope you have a great year in this class! If you put in the time and effort, you will be really successful and gain skills that you can use for the rest of your life. Best of luck to you all! . Sahil: .",

            "title": "Hello to Python",
            "content": "Hello, World! . These examples show the basic language structures and constructs of Python using print and input commands (aka anatomy). . Print command using Static Text which performs output . The classic introduction to a programming language is to output a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. In Python, this is a print statement. . The command or function is print() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the print command. | The print command outputs the parameter to the terminal, as you see it in this Jupyter document | Output in Jupyter Notebook is below the code cell. Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions. Python print typically outputs to a terminal, we will see that when students start using Visual Studio Code. | . print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) . Dynamic example showing variables, input and output . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example takes input from the user and stores the input into a variable called msg (short for message), then outputs the msg to terminal. - This example is Dynamic as the input and output can change each time the code is run. . A variable &quot;msg&quot; is part of both statement The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used to capture the input command | The variable &quot;msg&quot; is then used as a parameter to print command, causing input to be output to terminal, or in Jupyter Notebook below the code cell. | . | The &quot;input&quot; command activates the jupyter notebook input box, which obtains input from the user (try it!) the &quot;msg&quot; variable is the dynamic result of the input command | . | The print command outputs the &quot;msg&quot; variable captured in the input statement note, msg is a parameter to the print function | . | Input and Output in Jupyter Notebook Input is NOT in line with Output, this is a little annoyance and requires familiarity. Input and Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions. Python print typically obtains input and outputs to a terminal, students will see that when they run Python programs using Visual Studio Code. | . msg = input(&quot;Enter a greeting: &quot;) print(msg) . Building a Function . This example adds to the basics of the Python anatomy, a function. Input, output, and grouping commands in functions is the key to most programming languages. This example simulates a free response answer to a question. . The &quot;def question_and_answer(prompt)&quot; now contains multiple indented commands, the commands print and input were learned previously. | Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Procedure, Function, def are all synonyms in the Python language. | The &quot;def&quot; is a key word in Python that defines a function. Using this keyword defines a group of commands, but does not run them initially. | The name of the function in this example is &quot;question_and_answer&quot;. In essence, we are defining our own command within the Python language. | The three &quot;question_and_answer&quot; commands that follow the function and indented commands allow this function to be run. | This code of the function is then run multiple times, each command line providing a unique &quot;prompt&quot; as a result of the literal parameter passed to the function. | The function takes a parameter called &quot;prompt&quot;, which is a message output to the user to describe the input requested. | String concatenation &quot;+&quot; prefixes the prompt with the literal message &quot;Question: &quot;. | The &quot;msg&quot; variable is captured as a result of the jupyter notebook input supplied by the user | The input &quot;msg&quot; is output back to the user with &quot;Answer: &quot; concatenated to the front. | . def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + msg) question_and_answer(&quot;Name the Python output command mentioned in this lesson?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;If you see many lines of code in order, what would College Board call it?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Describe a keyword used in Python to define a function?&quot;) . Imports, Selection, and Logical Expressions . In Python anatomy of you will be importing libraries and functions. This is code that is developed by others. In this example we are importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of your existing system. Additionally, this example uses the custom function defined earlier in the Jupyter document. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import | . Next, this example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question. . response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | if command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | .

College Board is trying to remain neutral and build Computer Science Principles off of any language, thus the Teacher is left to pick the language(s) according to application and curriculum. . Exam Reference Sheet . Comparison of CB Pseudo Code to Python with descriptions . Command Vocabulary | Pseudo code | Python | Purpose | . Output | DISPLAY(expression) | print(expression, end=” “) | Displays the value of expression, followed by a space. Python defaults to newline, thus the end=” “ | . Input | a ← INPUT() | a = input(prompt) | Accepts a value from the user and returns it to the variable a. | . Assignment | a ← expression | a = expression | Evaluates expression and assigns the result to the variable a. | . Selection | IF (expression) | if expression: | Run commands in the code block associated with the selection | . Iteration n times | REPEAT n TIMES | for i in range(n): | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration n times | . Iteration expression | REPEAT UNTIL (expression) | while expression: | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration while expression is true | . List Assignment | list ← [expression1, expression2, expression3] | list = [expression1, expression2, expression3] | Assigns 3 values to list, value can be literal or expressions | . First index in List | list[1] | list[0] | Access the 1st element in the list[]. FYI, most programming languages start a zero. | . Last index in List | list[LENGTH(list)] | list[len(list) - 1] | Access the last element in the list[]. If you start at zero, last element is length - 1. | . Define Procedure | PROCEDURE name (parameter) | def name(parameter): | Create a procedure containing a sequence of programming instructions. | . Expression equals | a = b | a == b | Evaluate if assigned value of a equals assigned value of b | . Expression not equals | a ≠ b | a != b | Evaluate if assigned value of a is NOT equal to assigned value of b | . Pseudo IF Code Block using curly braces . a ← 1 b ← 1 IF (a = b) { DISPLAY(&quot;A equals B&quot;) } . Python IF Code Block using indent . a = 1 b = 1 if (a == b): # Python uses indent to establish code block, Teacher use tab key print(&quot;A equals B&quot;) . Suggestions for students . It is very important that you become fluent in “Command Vocabulary” and “Purpose” of the Pseudo Code versus Python comparison. During the year you will look at JavaScript which has same Command Vocabulary and Purpose. Others may take Java, you will see the same ideas again. . Start building Vocabulary and Purpose by Code/Code/Coding | Supplement you Code with comments and outputs using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. This style allows you to code explore and learn as you go. | Use CB pseudo code as part of your definitions as you build your notebooks. | . Hacks .

            "content": "Computer Science Principles Code.org . Monday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . . Code.org is sponsor. Lesson are from published Curriculum Guide. . Introduction is on equity. 50% girls in school should mean 50% enrollment in CSP | Follow up dates. Saturdays 10/15, 11/19, 1/28, 3/18 | Met Ken Toma (Canyon Hills, SD), Faith Yeaton (San Gabriel Academy, Pasadena area), Ms O&#39;Masters (Central Valley) | Worked with Sean Yeung who is new to my school :). I would like to see a lot of him this week. | Lesson 3 Plan What are 3 things you notice about the lesson plan? Circle and square patterns is a lite intro into binary. Number 7 and permutations of squares and circles are showing representations, which are leading to 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s that students will see in future. Group work is used, as one Teacher said in our session... &quot;to make sure the work gets done&quot;. | What are 2 things you have questions about? I believe 15-18 age group should be able to combine this with binary lesson in same amount of class time listed for this lesson plan (45 minutes). Elaboration on this would seem like a fall back for me for the few in my school that don&#39;t get binary directly. IMO, binary should be taught in detail when needed, my plan is to teach it through color codes and through binary calculator; the later inspired by Harvard CS50. IMO, in modern languages and frameworks we don&#39;t want to lead students down the binary grind until they get interested in CS or binary as part of an application solution. College Board seems to have delayed this to Big Idea 2 and teaches concepts around data abstraction and data compression. | What is 1 thing you are interested to find more about or are excited about when you look at this lesson? Since we are starting in a lesson, I would like to see 12 weeks or course vision. I feel like this is a very isolated and simple topic. Though, it is an easy thing for Teachers to get to know each other. Perhaps, for our event it is more about Collaboration from Big Idea 1 then Binary in Big Idea 2. | . | . . Monday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Binary Number System slide #99. The activity requires paper and Teacher thinks analog experience is important. Connect Circle-0 / Square-1. Teacher recognizes different experience level but thinks everyone should create flippy-do. Code.org vocabulary is last, but not to be ignored. . Relation is focussed on these concepts 0-9 are symbols for numbers in Base 10 | 0-1 are symbols for numbers in Base 2 | . | Make an adaptation to support Flippy-Do information: Binary Calculator | The 2048 game might be interesting development activity to relate to binary. | This is a general slide on all lessons slide #121. | Color Codes inserted into these lessons seems key to me, or some other purposeful element, encryption was mentioned by Teacher. In general, not seeing “why?” in Code.org lessons as we start… but the appear in the high level description. | . Compare Unplugged and Plugged Lessons. . What is teacher doing in unplugged lesson? encouragement, walking around, answering questions. Unplugged is not computer: Stand-up meeting, White Board Design | Let them Explore!!! Shared an idea of plugged lesson, shared a tool. Don’t lecture about it, as them what it does, what is happening? | . Teachers role is described as Lead learner. We may not know, but we can figure it out. My response to questions… . Lead learner allows diverse activities in classroom | Lead learner may provide completely different work for student with special interests or special needs. | Teacher (Jennifer) suggested she needs to build the computer science muscle, including suffer confusion. Student (Patrick) mentioned that students see straight into your capability. | Different rhythms for different students. | Blogging Platforms mentioned | Peer Feedback mentioned | Pair Programming mentioned | . Actions for inclusive classroom culture . Group thought it is more on capability versus culture | Student (Sonya) talked about doing multiple media types (paper, digital) | Student (Patrick) discussed audio and video slides for virtual | Student (Ken Toma) give everybody a voice. Suggested pair-share can provide that platform | . Async work . This video discusses a lot of what I believe in and will kickoff PBL well. I think it popped up by accident but it was cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s29LKfEFjQ | Watched the place, mostly it has a place to complete async activities and surveys. It says I am not enrolled when I attempt survey. | The Place introduced. | . Tuesday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Module 2 Intro Slides . USC represented shared Web Site | Unit 1 Lesson 7. Played with B/W Widget, on building black and white images. Idea was good on 1st couple of exercises, it quickly seemed to become tedious. I am not sure how it would related to key concepts in CB and not happy with it in PBL (except if we add improvement or design elements). Interaction could be improved to maintain orientation of Hexadecimal to lines. Maybe coding improvement could be to preserve orientation and allow clicking on pic, binary, or both. This exercise in driver navigator would make a lot of sense. Worked with Jp Fletcher, Jason Mahoney, Manuel Hernandez | Unit 1 Lesson 8. Color Images Widget, I like this for the 1st lesson more. It seems like the stair step is not significant and perhaps this might provide more joy. Somewhat a combination of two lessons would make me happier, perhaps one black/white and then color would be good for interactive lecture. Using page: https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2022/lessons/8/levels/2 04 02 18 FF0000 00FF00 0000FF 000000 FFFF00 FF00FF 00FFFF FFFFFF . | Course Framework page 16, computation thinking practices and big ideas. Learning objectives and essential knowledge. | Async was on Big Ideas, Computational Thinking practices,… In my experience I focus in on covering the Big Ideas. Students don’t seem to relate will to other weightings. Also, I focus on CTE principle of College Ready through test and Intern ready through PBL. If we teach them to build stuff a lot of the other things fall out. | . Tuesday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Kickoff was reviewing scavenger hunt. People generally have questions as new teachers. . Teacher (Katie) reviewed CB outline. My experience is by doing CB MCQs and PBL, the students think questions are easy/basic. | Next (Katie) covered the Code.org outline. Unit 1-3 cover Big Idea topics in 1, 2, 4. Units 4-7 cover Big Idea 3. | Some discussion on block coding vs scripted in Create Task Project. | . Transition to Unit 1 Lesson 9-10 Lossless/Lossy Compression. Widget Bubble 1 . Played with Text to Symbol compression, Ken Toma came up with multiple words. | Spoke on introduction, we instructed Patrick to look for associations to make this interesting. | Lossy compression had a reduction widget | Lossy compression had a pick quality slide voting | Summary on these, widgets and ideas are great for intro, but they don’t seem to have depth that I like in the lesson. I want people to learn how to do these. | . Async session had a video that shared review of things we missed in workshop versus code.org curriculum. This filled some gaps that I thought were missing in order that we followed. . How you interact with the World. | For tomorrow, there is talk of Internet Simulator / Messaging System that may be good illustration and complement to a Tech Talk. I wonder, do they provide code for these tools? That would be a great thing to teach students to make, it looks like it works over sockets because of instant refresh. | . Wednesday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Internet Unit A new day of slides . Paseo Reflection . Strongly: identify Coach, Parent | Life Advantage: Being Chinese, Entrepreneur | Equity: Teacher, Coach/Teaching | Feel, Identity: Balance on sharing (ego heavy, selling short). Mental health and physical health are important on reflection, feeling selfish. Give people benefit in process of their evaluation. | . Network Challenge. This is the challenge that was familiar to classroom and Colin made this as an app a couple of years ago. . Two people share a line | Multiple connections from persons to lines | Teachers are holding a lot of stock in simplicity and activity. Though, Network are multiply connected to routers and not computers and Network design is complex. It should be clarified that most home computers have a single router. A,B,C,D,E should be conceptual. ISP typically have multiple paths and home networks do not. It is interesting that Group 4 used a hub, challenge #3; this tells me that people are going to think it is computers. | . IP Addresses and DNS. Started by making a series of appointments. Not much purpose of this other than addressing names and getting a response. Creating a packet of data (Monday, Cheanie) response (OK). . Async work . Mental pictures Blind spots, accept you have them and work on them. Female: delicate, caring family | Male: career, strong, powerful | . | Article summary is holding ourself accountable for bias, as I am sure I have some bias that is reflected in my work. However, I believe most of my personal bias has to do with classroom behavior of the individual. Other notes: sometimes students are looking for bias | Difficulty: those that have history (good or bad) in a year long classroom have difficult going good to bad or bad to good in my eyes. Certainly someone who starts great gets a lot of my respect and favoritism. | . | Digital information dilemmas, game companies can’t use Lebron James tattoos. There is so much copyright, I am not even sure I can take notes and represent pictures, but I do it. | . Wednesday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Network Simulator and Bias . Network Simulator would be really fun if code was available. I think I would like to mimic it for a development project. Students really resonate toward building this type of thing. It could be built on top of Logging and Image thing. | Bias discussion and my problems exists or are established on behavior. I have favorite students and even invite them into Nighthawk Coding Society. Or they invite themselves. | Student attitude may have something that needs exploration. | . Async work is mostly a couple of videos and ability to comment on the material. These are particularly good ideas and are somewhat built into GitHub pages. . We should have students comment on most of the lessons or the day after the lessons. This could be a great way to obtains some feedback in context. | Network simulator may be a tool that we could build in class, it would be an interesting project for a team that wants to code. | . After hours work. Because of discussion of awarding people on doing things conversation, plus many asking questions about how to score on doing things… I went back and updated hacks and worked with Sean on getting comments working on Tools Setup. IMO, this solves problem of presenting, providing what to do, and capturing in the same place. . Thursday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Who Belongs in CSP? Thursday Slides . Unit 3 Bridge to programming units starting with Lesson 2 Design Mode, student work in AppLab | Stocks, has several rows and columns. It show a graph and has current price. If you click on a stock it takes you to articles written about the stock | . MSFT /graph 274.17 AAPL /graph 155.98 . Block coding tool is big focus. Pace is slow. | Design session introduced JavaScript commands. It showed onEvent with a function. There is kind of a confusing design and tool back and forth, mostly presenter and online issues. | . Async very quick example that seems to beg for me to say yes to intervention. But IMO, there are bigger fish to fry than someone knowing a stats answer. . BTW, we saw many mistakes presented in Networking lines game, but people were not speaking up. Sometimes it is best to let people just have an answer. | Debugging was topic in video. Positive “make mistakes message”, goes with grading comment made to have check boxes for points, not right or wrong. Learning is a process, everything does not need ot be corrected. | . Planning notes for an Application like the Birds sample, mostly use their code with minor adaptations… . - Stock Quiz - Start Screen Begin Button — 1 — What is most valuable stock on US exchanges? Apple (AAPL) and three wrong — 2 — What is Robin Hood darling stock in 21-22? Game Stop and three wrong — 3 — What is a good philosophy in market? Buy low Sell high and three wrong — Winner Screen — Congrats. Here are some tips before you go invest… Open, Close, Day High/Low, 52 week average — Wrong Answer Screen — Try again, wrong answer. You must get the right answer to continue (move on). . Thursday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Lab work. Best link for AppLab. My biggest observation was not about the lessons, it was about the cohorts and their Lab work. Many of them were with very excited about their creations. AppLab made some successful and really picked up their excitement. I think Wednesday was a downer for me and perhaps a lot of others and it carried with me into Thu. Today many spirits were lifted. . IMO, Tech success lifts spirits | Teacher cohorts like to see that they coded. AppLab example on QA’s seems to be very intuitive for new coders. I know students like a Quiz and they can lead into Data Analytics, so it is not a bad thing. | I was helping someone that was very new (Patrick) and he seemed to have some intuition about things like Label, Text Box, Button. | Less intuition on Sequencing and Events. Perhaps their should be a little intro to these structures, like placing code inside of events. Also, my view was a little difficult so it was difficult to be a great Pair Programmer as I should have caught some extra clicks in producing excess code. | Finally, Pair Programming is an interactive two brain process. It was weird to hear facilitator talk about Driver/Navigator as if Navigator is more in command position. | . Friday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Saturday Oct 15, Dec 3, Jan 28, Mar 18 workshop days. . Equity in CompSci Classroom. Sindie talked about zero experience, not only the smart student. . Work load. (Asian, 50% Indian) Mental health is a bigger focus for this year (work load management, more in class work, but lots of information at the beginning of year) | Sonya parent pressure, grade 1st (Korean) Debugging the Gender Gap (video), “what does a coder look like?”. | Jason variety not just group work (Hispanic) | Patrick email: Patrick.davis@inglewoodusd.com | . Assessment changes . Here is instructors percentage guide | Many seem to NOT have a system for this as they don’t have a vision of what they will teach yet. | . CTE/Admin Report with focus on Pathway . Regarding CompSci Pathway, there are no standards. Districts and even schools pick. . My understanding is Districts pick their Curriculum Provider and it often requires Teachers to get a certificate. Code.org is fulfilling district/certificate requirements. Code.org is providing a completely closed platform with its own LMS and tools. | USC and UCSD attachments to Code.org are both using an ncsu.org. NC State system to aggregate teacher completion, for example async work must be captured in the tool. My thoughts are USC, UCSD, NC State are involved in some sort of grant program as an individual pops in and promotes on campus events and opportunities for teacher to get certificate that will help boost pay. There was a USC off campus host managing the class, they are giving Teachers some swag and hours toward certificate. Teachers at training had little and mostly no CompSci experience. | . CS Discovery is a Code.org brand. According to PLTW web site their brand is Essentials. . College Board Lists Curriculum Providers | From Code.org What is CS Discoveries CS Discoveries is designed to fit naturally between our CS Fundamentals courses and our CS Principles course | Computer Science Discoveries is an introductory computer science course for 6 - 10th grade students. | . | From PLTW.org the name is CS Essentials This lists Essentials, Principles, A, Cybersecurity | Principles description has Cybersecurity emphasis | . | . Of course College Board is another business which in turn is advertising groups like Code.org or PLTW.org. However, the are also list Apple which is listed as a provider of curriculum for CompSci Principles. This is kind of fun for me, as it goes back to my Intro year, but this content can be used for CS Principles. Develop in Swift AP CS Principles curriculum helps students build a foundation in programming using Swift—a powerful and intuitive open source programming language designed by Apple—while preparing them for the AP Computer Science Principles Exam. Students will get practical experience with the tools, techniques, and concepts needed to build an iOS app. They’ll learn about the impact of computing, privacy, and security on society, while exploring the technology behind their own activities through interactive stories. Develop in Swift AP CS Principles includes a student and teacher guide available for free on Apple Books. Downloadable Xcode and Playground project files are also available to support the curriculum activities . Back to CTE, the students and teacher. Teacher motivations can vary. My philosophy is teach content and test will fall out. Yesterday I had a Teacher in our breakout say to me… Bottom Line, I want all my students to get 100% on AP exam. End of story. But, I don&#39;t think the Code.org platform, the training I got, and me are going to make it happen. A Student was working with me yesterday and we were dialoguing on Slack. He was working with me on something wrt his internship that was related to certificate deltas between Windows and MacOS. I told the student about my Code.org training I don&#39;t really like the code.org method. My friend goes to a different school and took AP CSP using that curriculum. I personally was unimpressed with that I told the student that I was looking at a softer entrances into PBL I don&#39;t think code.org is the solution, coming from a student perspective. You might want to take a more traditional class approach by teaching everyday at the beginning, which is what students are used to. Then ease into PBL Also, yesterday I had several students working with me on next years classroom tooling. From this experience, all students had their own blogging and tooling platform. IMO, Student are the center. Thus, object should form around student. Not Code.org or LMS. This means they need their own tools and their own objects. This means an open platform to express their engineering . Summary. Sharpen the sword is a phrase used in habit of highly successful people. I learned a lot during the week from Code.org training and platform. Also, I got great exposure to many new teachers entering into Computer Science. I am happy that there is something for these people to grab onto. Also it helped me provide a lesson idea for Sean in our 3rd week (related to interest in block coding). But, for me this is a case of sharpening the sword, there is no intention to adopt the entire curriculum. I hope to continue with my existing approach to CSP curriculum: PBL, Open Platform. Sword sharpening includes: adding softer entries to topics, more traditional lectures in Trimester 1, build muscle for longer term PBL. .",

CS-Students is a sample knowledge graph that can be used to model any classroom that is relation based (a classroom that has lots of different people, pairs, groups, periods; things like that). This notebook is meant to demonstrate how to query this knowledge graph based on the preset things that are currently in the sample data. . Data . Currently, the data consists of the following categories (which are labels in Neo4J): . Period (most teachers would find it useful to have their data divided into class periods) . Scrum Team (basically, the largest overarching groups of students, under period) . Pairs (pairs of students within scrum teams) . Person (object that represents each student) . The data also has the following relationships . IN_PERIOD (to relate teams to the period they are in) . CROSSOVER (a relationship that exists to connect pairs of teams which work together) . PAIR_SHARE (relationship defining students who are paired together) . IN_GROUP (to relate people to the group they are in) . Setup in Anaconda . 1: Install Anaconda . 2: On windows, open the Anaconda command prompt. On mac, open the normal terminal. . 3: Run the following commands: . conda install jupyter . conda install py2neo . conda install pandas . conda install neo4jupyter . 4: If you haven&#39;t already, then clone this repository to a location that you can navigate to easily in your files. . 5: The commands above have configured your conda environment. Now, simply run the command . jupyter notebook . 6: This should open up something in the browser. You will see all of your files.

Qualcomm makes its money on patents, if you use GPL software you could be voiding your rights to charge for software and patents. Open Source by nature, specifically GPL, says any derivative work is free and code should be shared. Qualcomm wants all derivative work to require a royalty payment payment, also anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty. . . From synopsis.com, “Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers.” Qualcomm has had 20 technical jobs and 3 lawyers analyzing all the code produced, analyzing code for Open Source inclusion, and analyzing impact of such licenses to its ability to charge royalties for the use of their Patents. . This may sound like a simple problem, but think about the Students of Today, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet. Well, don’t think the Workers of Today are entirely different. In summary, it is important to know the type of software license you are copying, it could impact billions of dollars in business. . License Communities, License Types Guide . Adding and selecting a license GitHub instructions. An author, a licensor, needs to determine a license. This may result in asking… Do I want to waive default copyright in reuse? | Do I want to allow derivative works or not? | Do I want to require all derivative code to be shared? | | . Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal . The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you’ve created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain. . Open Source MIT License . This license in friendly to someone like Qualcomm! This allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions. . Open Source GPL License . The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. . For a company like Qualcomm, they are required to institute many practices to deliver their code in parts. Isolating their patent and secret code, far away from the GPL Creative Commons code. In fact, a company that is protecting their patents may need to division engineers, split distribution code, etc. Even though, the customer of the derivative work is required to put the code back together again to make it work. . Legal and Ethically . We need to comply with the terms of licenses. We need to cite sources. (I am particularly bad with internet pictures. However, in the picture of the Black Duck above I am actually advertising the Company). . As consumers, we have become aware that Music and Movie companies own content. These companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content. Most of us buy subscriptions to services. However, some figure out ways to bypass systems and allow download. Often we will see these sites disappear, as they are illegal. . In software, it can be more complicated to understand all the Creative Commons licenses and its impact to our own ideas and businesses. Mostly, if we use things in class, there is no problem with Open Source as it is considered educational use. Creative Commons software has enabled amazing innovation as we are able to do so much for free, as we have done in this class. However, Individuals and Companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license. . Long ago, I remember being amazed that Red Hat was not selling its Linux distribution, they were giving away the software. They had to as the terms of the license were GPL. However, as an early pioneers in Linux distributions, they established a business model around buying their support agreement. They rose in fortune, became a public company, and had an amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO). Many, many vendors have followed the Red Hat model in building free distributions and establish unique business models. Qualcomm figured out how to mix Patent and GPL businesses and have flourished since abandoning all proprietary, to include Android in its very complicated business model. . Creative Commons, Open Source are free terminologies! However, businesses will not last without income. And today, businesses won’t last without engineers pulling Open Source software. .

Frontend web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website through a Browser. In this class, we will be using Fastpages on top of GitHub Pages to maximize our presentations, while minimizing our front-end coding. GitHub Pages deployment is performed through Jekyll, which regenerates the website automatically after each commit, tracking can be seen in Actions tab within GitHub. | HTML generation is performed through Liquid, a template language (similar to Jinja2 or Thymeleaf). | CSS style layout is provided by using Themes provided through GH Pages. Each page we make we assume the defined theme and insert our HTML fragments, local page style, and local page JavaScript. | JavaScript enables pages to have actions, fetch content, animate, etc | . . . Code in this Sub Menu . HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front-end of the Web. Many tools and languages complement development using markup, style and JavaScript. This section of the Nighthawk Coders CS website is providing some code samples. These are intended to spark your own PBL ideas. Each of these were generated after watching others teach or interacting with students. . Tutorial: This page is a FastPages _post. This page contains Markdown and HTML. Pull this file into VSCode and explore the fundamentals of making a content page. | Calculator: This calculator was inspired by Mr. Mortensen’s calculator that he built in Objective-C during his first year of teaching at DNHS (2019). It was recreated by former student Anthony using Fastpages, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS on this site in 2022. Creating a calculator helps developers to learn how to manage temporary data, manage presentation, associate input to calculator output, and work with logic | Visually it shows how math works within a language; specific functions, handling of strings, numbers, math, etc. | . | Binary: This example was created after watching Harvard CS50 by David J. Malan in 2020, he had built a machine to turn on and off lights/binary digits. My thought after watching machine, why not simulate that binary machine in software? Liquid is used to define a constant for the number of bits | JavaScript is used base 2, 8, 16 calculations | . | Grades: This grade calculator was created to show interaction of HTML and JavaScript to perform input. Additionally, it show how to add element to HTML Document Object Model (DOM). FYI, the IJavaScript kernel did not support input as of this writing. | Graph: This was created when a student named Bryant 2022 asked me the question “how would I plot data?” as described in an FRQ.

Python and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Python RESTful API libraries. A Python List is used to make a Data Model, but persistence in this technique is limited, each time server is refreshed data is lost. This example is great for learning, but data is considered volatile. | Users: Another RESTful API library example. However, this backend establishes data persistence through the use of a database. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Python to define REST APIs. Python tools are very popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods. The Users RESTful APIs would likely contain these endpoints. | GET: /users =&gt; Get a list of users | GET: /users(id) =&gt; Get a single user | POST: /users =&gt; Create a new user | PUT: /users(id) =&gt; Update a user | DELETE: /users(id) =&gt; Delete a user | . Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",
